                        The World Rainforest Fund (WRF) has established the following criteria in response to a number of requests for grants from us. The criteria are listed in the following grant application, which must be completed to receive a grant from WRF. The application has sixteen items to complete. Please read the application carefully. All items must be completed and all criteria must be met to receive a grant. If your organization does not meet all the criteria, we suggest you do not apply until you have taken the necessary action to have met them all. These criteria are also provided to show our donors how conscientious, selective, careful, and strict we are in selecting grantees, to assure the dollars of our supporters are used to maximal effectiveness.

Preservation takes precedence over restoration. Rainforests have the highest priority because they generally have the highest biodiversity. Dry forests have the lowest priority because their biodiversity, although high, is generally lower than the other tropical forests.</p>

Two paragraphs is usually sufficient. It must be very specific, describing the project, how it will save tropical forest, how it will help the indigenous or local people involved, an estimate of how many acres of tropical forest will be saved if practical, and any other pertinent information.</p>

This video should be of sufficiently high quality for the WRF to use for fundraising purposes. This requirement can be waived if the organization convinces the WRF Board that this is unrealistically difficult.</p>

Doubling the grant we give with a matching grant is typical and generally the minimum, or at least a good goal. The larger the matching funds, the better the chance of approval of the application. The grant from the WRF must help the organization raise the money of the matching grant for this criterion to be met. We are willing to help conceive, advise on, and even implement this plan in many cases. An example of this would be a fundraising campaign on a crowdfunding site, such as Indiegogo or Gofundme. We consult and advise on crowdfunding campaigns, and have been successful at helping organizations with this in the past. Other examples would be a fundraising campaign on Facebook or phoning a list of potential donors. The plan of action to leverage our grant must not consist of actions the recipient organization was planning to do regardless of whether they applied for a grant from us. Rather, it must be inspired by the fact that they are seeking our funds.</p>

The higher the biodiversity, the better the chance of a positive decision from us.</p>

                            <p><strong class="text-emerald-900">12.</strong> Show that the chance of success of the project and goals of the organization are significantly increased if it receives a grant from the WRF. We do not favor projects that would probably fail or succeed whether or not they receive a grant from us. We favor projects that would likely fail without our grant and succeed with it.</p>

                            <p><strong class="text-emerald-900">13.</strong> Demonstrate that the organization can accomplish its goals or be substantially aided with a small grant. We are a small organization and deal with small amounts of money. If the organization seeking help has a project that requires large sums of money to achieve success and will not be significantly helped by a small grant from us, it is best they apply elsewhere. Typical grants from the WRF are $5,000.00 to $10,000.00.</p>

The interviewer must give a favorable report of this interview to the WRF Board of Directors.</p>

This requirement can be waived in rare cases where this is determined to be impractical for legitimate reasons by the WRF Board of Directors. If the organization has another organization representing it in the USA, provide this representing organization's most current independently audited financial statement, and its most current 990 form. The latter is the form that must be presented in accordance with IRS regulations. This requirement may be met by providing an internet link to this form or these forms.</p>

                            <p><strong class="text-emerald-900">16.</strong> The organization must agree to file, and file, periodic progress reports when we ask for them, reporting progress on the phone or by email, giving a written report when the project is completed, supplying evidence of their accomplishments, and any other relevant form of accountability to us. No more grants will be given until an adequate report is filed. The WRF Board may withhold 10% of the grant until after the first report is filed if it chooses to do so. List the organization's contact person or contact people that is (are) responsible for this report (these reports). This person (these people) must be responsive, available, and easy to access, to discuss the project we are supporting and its progress and accomplishments. Typically, one progress report six months after the grant is awarded and another one year after it is awarded are what are necessary and sufficient to meet this requirement, but this may not always be the case. The organization must be honest, hard-working, effective, knowledgeable, experienced, and accountable.</p>
