                    <p>Rainforest Connection (RFCx) creates acoustic monitoring systems for those who wish to end illegal deforestation in real-time.<br>Illegal deforestation is a gateway activity to clearing rainforest, one of the primary causes of climate change. According to the UN, up to 90% of logging in tropical rainforests is illegal.</p>
                    <p>The reason Rainforest Connection starts with a focus on stopping illegal logging is because, in case after case, they have seen first-hand that if you can protect the trees, you end up protecting everything else.</p>
                    <p>The RFCx monitoring system gives their partners the opportunity to protect key rainforest areas and respond to real-time alerts, while sharing large amounts of ecosystem data that help negotiate increased protections in these areas. In some cases, protecting the perimeter of a rainforest can actually mean protecting everything behind it.</p>
                    <p>They are dedicated to putting conservation technologies into the hands of committed partners on-the-ground to help combat the destruction of Indigenous reserves which comprise 20% of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest, now increasingly targeted by illegal loggers and poachers because they are still intact.</p>
                    <p>They use recycled cell phones powered by solar energy in trees to detect illegal logging. This allows guards to arrive in 20 minutes to stop the poachers. The alternative to this, satellites to detect the logging, can take up to 2 days to get enforcement people to stop the illegal loggers.</p>

                    <p>The Nature Conservancy is a global environmental nonprofit working to create a world where people and nature can thrive.<br>Founded at its grassroots in the United States in 1951, The Nature Conservancy has grown to become one of the most effective and wide-reaching environmental organizations in the world. Thanks to more than a million members and the dedicated efforts of our diverse staff and more than 400 scientists, they impact conservation in 72 countries across six continents.<br>Among other things, they buy land to preserve it. This includes rainforest in tropical countries.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mission</strong><br>To conserve the land and waters on which all life depends. Their vision is a world where the diversity of life thrives, and people act to conserve nature for its own sake and its ability to fulfill our needs and enrich our lives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Tackle Climate Change</strong><br>Global temperatures have sharply risen over the last century, and it is clear that swift, bold action is required to avoid the increasingly severe impacts of climate change.</p>
                    <p><strong>Protect Land and Water</strong><br>They have helped protect more than 119 million acres of land, countless miles of rivers and streams and the world's largest oceans. And they plan to protect more by 2025.</p>
                    <p><strong>Provide Food and Water Sustainably</strong><br>Food demand is expected to increase by more than 50 percent in just the next 30 years as the world's population continues to grow—it's a challenge that can be met.</p>
                    <p><strong>Build Healthy Cities</strong><br>By 2050, two-thirds of people will live in cities. Thoughtful planning, smart growth and nature can generate benefits for communities, for people's health and for the economy.</p>
